# GDP Analysis for the CCAR Scenarios
---

&#8729; Each year, the Federal Reserve releases macroeconomic forecasts for the CCAR and DFAST regulatory exercises

&#8729; While each yearly scenario has been different, there are some noticeable patterns 

&#8729; Real GDP is analyzed for historical behavior and a forecasted estimate is made for the upcoming scenario release

Each year, the Federal Reserve refreshes their thirteen-quarter macroeconomic scenario forecast for use in the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test <a href="glossary.html#DFAST">(“DFAST”)</a> and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”). The three scenarios (baseline, adverse, and severely adverse) are critical input for the models and forecasts that determine each bank’s projected capital adequacy. While the first systemic stress test by the FRB was the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program in 2009, the current iteration of DFAST and CCAR stress testing formally began in 2013. This gives analysts five years of consistent regulatory forecasting to analyze.

Although some years of the stress test have had some “wild cards” in the scenarios, most notably negative interest rates in 2016, the forecasts generally follow a logical projection methodology. To provide some insight into the scenario projection stability, the forecasted time series for real GDP in the severe scenario will be examined. This series has the advantage of having some additional years of data, with severely adverse projections available for 2011 and 2012. The aggregated forecasts can be seen in the chart below.

Aside from 2011, there is a clear trend in each scenario. The first projected quarter has a sharp drop in GDP, followed by an even more severe GDP loss. The following quarters begin a recovery phase and each yearly iteration shows GDP returning to positive growth by the sixth projected quarter.

The recovery phase is followed by a strong growth period, with rates above those seen in recent years and in the baseline scenario. In particular, the last six quarters of the previous four years have all ended with the same growth rates (two quarters of three percent growth followed by four quarters of 3.9 percent growth). As this has been the standard for the last four years, the forecasted severe scenario for 2018 keeps the same pattern with the same rates. This leaves the forecast with a little more than half, or seven quarters, to estimate.

The next trend to consider is the overall loss in GDP, seen in the chart below. This chart measures the cumulative percentage drop in GDP from the start of the scenario to the point of maximum loss and the ending quarter after the recovery. In the past two years, the severity of the FRB forecast increased dramatically. Given the increasing length of the recovery as the years go by, the stress scenario can "afford" to incorporate more stress. For that reason, the anticipated FRB scenario will likely continue the trend of increasing loss.

Another observation from the previous two years of data is the loss rate of the initial three quarters. The 2016 and 2017 CCAR started with the same annualized losses of 5.1, 7.1, and 5.9 percent. While two years of consistency is not as strong as the previous assumption used for the recovery phase, the same loss rates are used in the estimate for the 2018 scenario.

Like many macroeconomic estimates, GDP is subject to revision. Thus, anticipating the upcoming GDP forecast requires not only a thirteen-quarter projection but an estimation of the GDP rates that will be used in the quarters before the forecast jump-off. 2017Q1 through 2017Q3 have used the most recent estimates available from the BEA as of December, which come in at 1.2, 3.1, and 3.2. However, a fourth quarter estimate has not been released, so 2.9 was used as an estimate for 2017Q4.

The average GDP rate for the last four quarters of actuals are available in the table below. While the FRB may use a lower growth rate than 2.9, it is likely that this year will have the highest average four-quarter growth rate, as seen in the following chart.

It is assumed that the recent historical economic conditions play a part in the scenario forecast. For the 2018 estimate, the higher growth recent growth rate means a greater loss rate in the projected severe scenario in projected quarters four through seven.

Thus far, only the severe scenario has been discussed. Given that CCAR and DFAST are stress tests, a large amount of coverage of the most stressful scenario is to be expected. However, the baseline projection from the FRB is also important.

In the chart above, the blue line represents a four-quarter moving average of the December 2017 historical GDP growth rates from the BEA. The dotted lines are the historical FRB baseline forecasts. In general, the baseline forecasts are flat while the actual GDP rates fluctuate significantly, even when smoothed using a moving average. In addition, the baseline forecast has been adjusted lower as GDP has trended lower.

The adjustment is easier to see in the chart below, where the forecasts generally continue the slope of the trend and jump-off slightly higher or lower depending on recent conditions. That is why the 2018 estimate is above last years-GDP growth in recent quarters has been strong!

The adverse scenario follows a methodology similar to aforementioned approaches. It has generally been an in-between average scenario for real GDP has opposed to an altogether curve. It has the same dip in the initial forecast followed by a recovery phase.

While this analysis does not cover the exact details or calculations used in the ultimate forecast. It hopefully provides the context for the historical behavior of the FRB CCAR and DFAST stress scenarios and an educated guess for the upcoming release of the 2018 data. An update will be made when the official scenario is released to compare results.

The final estimation can be seen in the chart at the beginning of this article, including 2017 trends as a comparison point. While it may not look very different than 2017, the scenarios have been fairly consistent and so, unless the FRB decides to make a drastic change, the upcoming release will be fairly similar to years past.
