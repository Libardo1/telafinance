# About

Bankcasting first launched in November 2017 to provide quantitative analysis on the current, past, and future state of the banking economy. Bankcasting aims to produce this analysis with independence and objectivity for the benefit of individuals within the banking profession and for those outside of the banking industry seeking to learn more about the field.

Given the pace of change within the industry during times of stress, forecasted analysis is an essential risk management technique to anticipate and prepare for adverse conditions. While the future is uncertain, the material within Bankcasting may be helpful to those seeking a quantitative approach to assessing potential future developments.
