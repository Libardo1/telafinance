# Introduction
Assets provide a fundamental gateway to balance sheet examination. They 
represent an essential aggregate measure for overall growth analysis and, 
therefore, a primary tracking metric.

## Choosing an Appropriate Proxy
Assets are in a constant state of flux. Thus, a balance sheet can only represent an estimate at a particular point in time. Quaterly financial filings allow for four of these asset snapshots in a given year.

For commercial banking institutions in the United States, call reports provide a template for comparison, benchmarking, and aggregation. They allow for a standardized analysis granularity that cannot be matched by other publicly available sources. Due to these favorable characteristics, domestic commercial banking assets for call-report-filing institutions provide a clear proxy of the overall banking economy for examination.

## Data Organization

Call reports are available for an average of 7,500 institutions during the 2001Q1 to 2016Q2 time period. Stitching together this data set over the aforementioned time period requires over 450,000 unique call reports representing over 715 million individual data points. In addition to the size of the data set, entities can be added, removed, or go through multiple iterations of addition and removal during this 62-quarter period. Accurate analysis depends on a careful flagging process on an individual bank level to parse organic and inorganic growth metrics.

## Data Reconciliation

To confirm the reasonability of this extensive data system and validate its proper construction, a benchmark for reconciliation from a secondary source has been tested. Due to obvious methodology and data-specific differences between approaches, an exact tie out is not expected. However, the benchmark provides assurance to the validity of the chosen methodology. image

As the diagram shows, the bankcasting data set is a subset of the total domestic commercial banking universe. However, when comparing the metric of total assets, this subset performs quite well.
