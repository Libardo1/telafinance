## Forecasting

The current net income forecast is nicknamed "Apollo" and is the first bankcasting forecast release. The forecast is made up of several components, the most material of which are presented here:

The forecast begins with scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve Board. The variables and their associated forecast feed an interest rate forecast and a provision forecast. The interest rates then drive a forecast for non-interest Income. Net income is therefore a product of these two individual material forecasts and several other forecasts that are currently less complex.

<p>

Using the FRB 2017 CCAR forecast scenarios, the Apollo forecast generates the following nine-quarter estimation for banking net income in the baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios.

The forecast produces reasonable results given the historical behavior of the time series. As the forecasting engine matures, additional components will be added and improved in an effort to continually enhance performance.
