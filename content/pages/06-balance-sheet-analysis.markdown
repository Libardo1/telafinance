# Balance Sheet Analysis

## Assets

### Growth

A review of the change in assets on a quarterly basis shows a 3.47% annualized increase from 2017Q1 to 2017Q2. This is 153bp less than the previous quarter of 5.00%. This comes a bit under the average over the last four quarters of 4.32%. Another quarterly increase means a continuation of the quarterly asset-increase streak, which now stands at 17 consecutive quarters of growth. The last decrease came in 2013Q1.
<p>
In general, assets for the banking sector increase through time, even during recession. 2009Q1 was the only quarter since 2001Q1 that assets had any sizeable decrease, a 10% annualized drop. 2009Q2 showed a 3% annualized decrease as well. As opposed to the income statement, which shows severe losses, the balance sheet stays steadier in general during crisis.
<p>
Further analysis of a nine-quarter rolling standard deviation shows a material volatility increase during the crisis, so the balance sheet isn’t completely immutable. Since the crisis, volatility has decreased noticeably. The 2004 to 2008 time period had an average 9Q rolling standard deviation of 6.4%. While the 2012 to 2016 period show only 3.6% for that measure. The most recent quarter had a standard deviation of 2.87%, down 3bp from 2.90% in 2017Q1.
