# Introduction

Bankcasting provides plain language explanations for financial topics and provides forecasts.

The forecasting framework currently generates 148 separate banking metrics for the balance sheet, income statement, and capital components for the entire banking industry over nine-quarters under three separate scenarios defined by the Federal Reserve Board. These line items are aggregated to produce a forecast for market-wide capital ratios for the banking industry. 

The latest results for the Tier 1 capital ratio forecast, using data up to and including 2017Q2, can be seen below.
