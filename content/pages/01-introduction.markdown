# Introduction

Bankcasting provides plain language explanations for banking topics and provides forecasts.

The forecasting framework currently generates 148 separate banking metrics for the balance sheet, income statement, and capital components for the entire banking industry over nine-quarters under three separate scenarios defined by the Federal Reserve Board. These line items are aggregated to produce a forecast for market-wide capital ratios for the banking industry. 

The latest results for the Tier 1 capital ratio forecast, using data up to and including 2017Q3, can be seen below.

The forecasting and analysis framework drives the written content of this website. Articles feature commentary on both the future state of the banking sector and analysis on the past trends and relationships that have occured.
