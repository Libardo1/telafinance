<h2 id="Capital_Ratio"></h2>

## Capital Ratio
A capital ratio calculates a measure of capital (common equity tier 1, tier 1, or total capital) over risk-weighted assets. Bank's don't hold one dollar of capital for every dollar of risk-weighted asset and so the ratio is an important measure of an institution's risk profile. In general, a higher capital ratio means a bank has more buffer to absorb losses. For capital stress testing purposes, the decrease in a bank's capital ratios is measured to determine if capital levels are sufficient.

<h2 id="CCAR"></h2>

## CCAR
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review: The framework used by the Federal Reserve to assess capital adequacy for banks with more than 50 billion in assets.

<h2 id="DFAST"></h2>

## DFAST
Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test: A regulatory stress test performed annually for banks between 10 to 50 billion in assets and twice a year for banks above 50 billion in assets.

<h2 id="FRB"></h2>

## FRB
Federal Reserve Board: Regulators. From a narrow lens of stress testing, they oversee the DFAST and CCAR framework. They are also responsible for a few other important things...like, you know, monetary policy for the entire US financial system. No big deal.
