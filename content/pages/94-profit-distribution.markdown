# The banking profitability distribution has some odd characteristics
---
<p>
&#8729; An experienced analyst wouldn’t expect many normal distributions in the finance world but a normal distribution does provide a useful starting assumption
<p>
&#8729; The banking profitability distribution looks normal at first glance around the mean
<p>
&#8729; However, the shape is not only negatively skewed and leptokurtic but also exhibits fat tails

Most practitioners can recall a time they were given the advice to “not assume normality.” Nevertheless, not only is the normal distribution one of the most basic statistical concepts taught but it is also one of the most pervasive assumptions used in finance (or any statistically approached field for that matter). It is often the starting point for distribution analysis and, unfortunately, the ending point as well. The largest reason being the non-intuitive nature of alternative frameworks…and, of course, laziness. However, one doesn’t need an advanced degree in statistics to apply some basic analysis to a given distribution and gain some insight into the behavior of a sample or population.

Profitability, measured here as net income, which is the final line on a bank’s income statement, is one of the most important metrics for performance analysis.
