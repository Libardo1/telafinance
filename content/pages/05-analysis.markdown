# Analysis

Bankcasting uses historical analysis as a basis for future projection. Currently, major components of the balance sheet and income statement are covered in sections 3.1. and 3.2., respectively.

## Banking Entities

The bankcasting data set covers data for a large set of reporting banks, allowing for the capture of significant market trends. The population of reporting banks that are part of the data set can be seen below.
