# Risk Culture

Risk culture covers an institution's evolving behavior, attitudes, and norms towards risk and risk management.

## Introduction

Cultural failures at banking institutions played a key role in the financial crisis and previous financial crises. While regulators currently have their primary focus of risk culture geared towards SIFIs, where failures of risk culture are most consequential to the market and public perception (e.g. Libor fixing, London whale), all institutions can improve their governance by understanding the concepts, pitfalls, and functions of a risk culture.

<p>

Risk culture is a qualitative factor and few, if any, well-defined metrics for assessment have been defined. Thus, review focuses on monitoring and proxies rather than measurement. Tools for review may be crude in the short term but they can still be employed and tested against pace of change and adoption.

## Defining and Developing a Culture

Definition of risk culture begins with the board. They should define the culture they want. The role of the CEO and CRO is to evidence the current culture, its evolution, improvements, and failures. Some boards have created culture and ethics committees but others have blended them into other processes stating their concerns that the committees may become to siloed.

<p>

Banks should seek to elevate the internal stature of risk culture, focusing on where it sits within an organization and whether it has proper authority. There are few roadmaps to developing and improving a risk culture but the end goals and expectations are well known.

<p>

Risk managers need to develop objective tools that allow for valid communication supported by metrics to present risk issues to their supervisors. Regulators expect risk managers to be part of business decision making, documenting whether they are present at meetings, identifying challenges offered in the minutes, and that risk factors are properly documented.

## Implementing Cultural Improvements
A phrase that is often used in risk management is "tone at the top." Executives and senior management must have buy-in to any program if they expect it to take root amongst the staff of any institution.
