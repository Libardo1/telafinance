# Charge-offs, Provision, and ALLL

---

&#8729; Credit losses are a critical driver of a bank's income statement 

&#8729; During downturns and times of stress, credit losses increase dramatically from baseline behavior, adversely affecting earnings and deteriorating capital

&#8729; Understanding the interaction between charge-offs, provision, and ALLL in a bank's credit loss management process is essential to analyzing banking performance over time

Charge-offs, provision, and allowance ("ALLL") are major components of a bank's credit risk and loss management process. Allowance sits on the balance sheet and acts as a buffer for future loan losses. These loan losses can arise for various reasons but, for simplicity, a main driver, lack of payment, is considered here. For a banking book of loans and leases, there is an expectation that some portion of loans may not be paid back. In a simple situation, if a bank has a thousand customers to each of whom they have provided a loan of one thousand dollars, the bank would ideally expect a full return of the aggregated one million in principal. In the real world, however, some of these customers may not repay those loans and the bank will end up losing money. So, banks carry a loss buffer, held as ALLL, with size dependent on the creditworthiness, macroeconomic conditions, and other factors.

The management of the ALLL buffer from quarter to quarter is important. If the creditworthiness of the loan group has deteriorated or improved, if the economy is showing improvement or warning of a recession, or by the many other possible factors, the expectations of the required ALLL buffer change. ALLL changes primarily through provision and charge-offs, whereby provision is taken as a loss on the income statement, increasing the ALLL buffer. Charge-offs decrease the ALLL buffer but do not affect the income statement. Therefore, in a situation where an increase of loan charge-offs, due to lack of payment or otherwise, is expected, banks will typically take provision in anticipation. As seen in the chart above, this behavior occurred during the previous crisis, where provision rose sharply at the start of the crisis and charge-offs occurred with a small delay. During the less severe recessions in 1991 and 2001, provision and charge-offs increased in a pattern more commensurate with each other.

Since the crisis, provision and charge-offs as a percentage of total loans and leases has dropped considerably and remained relatively flat. Banks have managed their ALLL buffer with smaller amounts of provision quarter-to-quarter and charge-offs have remained smaller as well. This reflects the decreased volatility of expectations amongst credit markets and the overall economy.
