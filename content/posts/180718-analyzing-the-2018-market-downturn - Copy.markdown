After an incredible year for stock returns in 2017, which saw the market rise 25%, the Dow Jones accelerated <i>even faster</i> in the new year, rising 7.7% in the first 18 trading days. It's not surprising to see the market cool off since then, down 11.6% at the worst point since the previous high.

What is surprising is the length of the market downturn. Whether investors want to attribute the cool off to trade wars, inverting yield curves, <a href="/blog/chinas-rise-in-gdp.html">competition from a rising China</a>, or some other narrative, the length of time since the market has set a new all-time high has been unusually long.

## So... when will investors get their money back?

While some stocks and sectors (e.g. tech) have continued to be successful this year, the Dow Jones has been stuck in the red since January 26<sup>th</sup>. The recovery period, measured as the number of trading sessions between all-time highs, is now the 25<sup>th</sup> longest wait in the last 118 years.

Any rationale investor might start to worry about when they will see a return on their investment. Like other <a href="/blog/can-you-hold-for-forty-years.html">historical analyses</a>, the table below can provide some context to better understand the current waiting period.

<img src="/img/2018-stock-market-recovery/longest-DJIA-recoveries.PNG" width="100%" alt="Longest Dow Jones recoveries by trading days" class="data-table"></a>

As the typical year contains about 252 trading days, the table shows that the Dow Jones took over a year to set a new all-time high in only sixteen instances. Right now, the current recovery sits at 120 days, or almost halfway towards joining that group of sixteen.

If the market fails to reach a new low before setting a new high by crossing above 26,616.71, it will be the third most mild downturn by loss in the list above. The 1990-1991 and 1994-1995 periods saw the least loss, at 8.1% and 9.7%, respectively.

The two major market crashes freshest in the mind of today's investors are fairly high on the list. The tech bubble sits in fourth place, while the 2008 financial crisis (though much more severe) sits in seventh place on the list. The loss of 53.8% in the 2008 crisis is only superseded by the Great Depression, at the top in severity and duration.

The most recent lengthy market recovery took place only a few years ago and is 15<sup>th</sup> on the list with a loss of 14.5%. So far, that period is looking relatively similar to the current year's performance.

## Benchmarking the current recovery

While the current market recovery is ongoing and may set new lows in addition to a continued duration, considering the downturn compared to similar periods yields significant insight. To determine a peer group for comparison, the ten recoveries greater than 120 days and ten less than 120 days ranked by similarity in duration are combined with the ten recoveries with a loss greater than 11.6% and less than 11.6%, ranked by similarity in loss. A simple Venn diagram depicts the overlap of these two groups, resulting in 30 peers for comparison.

To effectively visualize the dispersion of the peer group, a scatter plot based on duration and maximum loss is shown below.

<img src="/img/2018-stock-market-recovery/2018-recovery-vs-30-peers.PNG" width="100%" alt="2018 stock market recovery vs similar recoveries" class="scatter-chart"></a>

Based on the sample, a trendline was estimated and is presented as the dotted line on the scatter plot. The linear fit is fairly weak at 30% but serves as a useful visual aid for analyzing the current recovery.

Based on the trend, the duration and maximum loss are right around expectations. However, since the duration is ongoing, if the market doesn't turn downwards beyond the previous low, the maximum loss will likely end up slightly below expectations given the duration. So far then, the peer group suggests that the market is behaving about as well as one could predict given its characteristics and peers.

## 118 years of loss in one chart

To provide yet another useful visualization to analyze the 2018 market recovery, the chart below provides an alternative view of the Dow Jones from purely a downside perspective.

<img src="/img/2018-stock-market-recovery/DJIA-losses-from-peak.PNG" width="100%" alt="DJIA losses from peak since 1900" class="historical-loss-chart"></a>

While the 2008 crisis is the second worst loss on record, it is completely dwarfed by the 1929 crash and subsequent depression. In comparison, the current market turmoil is barely of note...so far. Since some investors use a 20% drop as defining a "bear market", the dotted line shows that the market losses since the crisis haven't come very close to hitting that psychological barrier.

The chart also provides some insight on market bull runs such as the 1990's or since the end of the financial crisis. Neither those periods of market gains nor any other period came without its share of bumps along the way.

## Don't be complacent

At the end of the day, whether a downturn comes relatively slowly like the tech bubble or quickly like the recent crisis, investors are rarely prepared for a major loss. Respect the adage to not invest more than one can afford to lose. It's unlikely to be more than a year between new highs but, if it is, having a rainy-day fund so that investments don't have to be pulled at a loss is always a good idea. Beyond that, one can just hope that we won't have to wait 25 years to see a new high like investors did after the Great Depression.
