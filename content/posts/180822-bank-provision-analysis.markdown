Credit losses are a critical driver of a bank's income statement. During downturns and times of stress, credit losses increase dramatically from baseline behavior, adversely affecting earnings and deteriorating capital. Understanding the interaction between charge-offs, provision, and ALLL in a bank's credit loss management process is essential to analyzing banking performance over time

Charge-offs, provision, and allowance ("ALLL") are major components of a bank's credit risk and loss management process. Allowance sits on the balance sheet and acts as a buffer for future loan losses. These loan losses can arise for various reasons but, for simplicity, a main driver, lack of payment, is considered here. For a banking book of loans and leases, there is an expectation that some portion of loans may not be paid back. In a simple situation, if a bank has a thousand customers to each of whom they have provided a loan of one thousand dollars, the bank would ideally expect a full return of the aggregated one million in principal. In the real world, however, some of these customers may not repay those loans and the bank will end up losing money. So, banks carry a loss buffer, held as ALLL, with size dependent on creditworthiness, macroeconomic conditions, and other factors.

The management of the ALLL buffer from quarter to quarter is important. If the creditworthiness of the loan group has deteriorated or improved, if the economy is showing improvement or warning of a recession, or by the many other possible factors, the expectations of the required ALLL buffer change. ALLL changes primarily through provision and charge-offs, whereby provision is taken as a loss on the income statement, increasing the ALLL buffer. Charge-offs decrease the ALLL buffer but do not affect the income statement. Therefore, in a situation where an increase of loan charge-offs, due to lack of payment or otherwise, is expected, banks will typically take provision in anticipation. As seen in the chart above, this behavior occurred during the previous crisis, where provision rose sharply at the start of the crisis and charge-offs occurred with a small delay. During the less severe recessions in 1991 and 2001, provision and charge-offs increased in a pattern more commensurate with each other.

Since the crisis, provision and charge-offs as a percentage of total loans and leases has dropped considerably and remained relatively flat. Banks have managed their ALLL buffer with smaller amounts of provision quarter-to-quarter and charge-offs have remained smaller as well. This reflects the decreased volatility of expectations amongst credit markets and the overall economy.

Observing the trends over time versus recessionary periods, there is a clear pattern. Initially, in quarters before a recession, charge-offs and provision begin to rise. This makes sense, as some customers will begin defaulting earlier than the bulk of customers in a risky pool. It may be useful to consider the development as a bell curve, where the initial uptick represents a small portion of the overall defaults that are soon to come. After a recession, charge-offs and provision continue, as these are the customers that ended up defaulting later than average for one reason or another. A recession coincides with the greatest incidence of provision, as banks adjust expectations given a greater realization of the macroeconomic shock.

Consider the crisis of 2008, clearly the most severe in the chart above. While there were signs of stress even before 2008, the full-blown panic did not manifest until later in 2008. The situation should have been more apparent to investors and practitioners sooner, as provision and charge-offs skyrocketed past historical norms but, when living through a crisis on a day-to-day basis, there can be some delay. Indeed, it can take many years after the fact to truly grasp the full extent of the damage.

The aforementioned reason is why the ALLL buffer takes much longer to return to pre-stress levels. Banks take provision and build the buffer but must remain cautious until well after a crisis officially ends. After 2008, there was talk for many years of a "double-dip" recession. While this fear went unrealized, it took almost six years for ALLL to flatten back to a normal behavior, similar to previous cycles.

<img src="/img/bank-provision-analysis/COversusRecoveryRate2017Q3.PNG" width="100%" alt="Charge-off versus Recovery Rate for the banking industry" class="technical-diagram">

Thus far, charge-offs have been considered on a net basis. However, net charge-offs have two components: charge-offs and recoveries. In the simple example used earlier, a bank may take a charge-off for a customer who doesn't pay back a loan. But, what if the customer eventually does pay back the loan, perhaps a year or two later when the charge-off and ALLL change has since taken effect? This is where recoveries come into use. They act opposite to charge-offs and increase the ALLL buffer. The reason why they are not explicitly discussed is they are a much smaller influence on net charge-offs, roughly 10%.

In the charge-off versus recovery rate chart, the minimal influence of recoveries is noticeable. First, the charge-off curve is very similar to the curve seen for net charge-offs in the first chart. Second, the axis for recoveries is a tenth of the axis for charge-offs.

That being said, recoveries are still worth mention and review. The trend is straightforward. Recoveries decrease towards the end of an economic cycle, reaching a low point during the recessions shown here. It makes sense from a crisis standpoint as businesses aren't as focused on fixing past-due defaults as they are on keeping the lights on.  Post-crisis, the behavior is expected - recoveries rise as defaults are recovered once businesses are able to survive the shock. However, as a business cycle matures, the amount of defaults available for recovery shrinks, as defaults become less common over time. A business can't offer a recovery if they haven't been defaulting.

As with any exercise in data or analysis, checking one's work is important. The primary data set used in this article comes from the FR Y-9C call report. However, another data set from the FFIEC was used for benchmarking purposes. It can be seen that the behavior of provision between the two sets is very similar (see the blue line versus the black dotted line in the first chart), providing further support to the estimates used in determining the "true" historical behavior.

In summary, provision is a major driver of income statement behavior during times of stress. When forecasting the income statement, provision is the typically primary driver for the overall shape of the net income curve in each scenario. Understanding charge-offs, recoveries, and ALLL allows analysts to better understand the credit loss framework and make inference about a bank's ability to absorb shocks through either their allowance buffer or their income statement. Charge-offs and provision also act as an early warning indicator for periods of stress and upticks should be treated seriously, as they may be just an initial proportion of a potentially larger rise to come.
