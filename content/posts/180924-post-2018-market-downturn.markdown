Back in July, it was noted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average ("DJIA") was taking <a href="/blog/analyzing-the-2018-market-downturn.html">a really long time to set a new all-time high</a>. Fortunately for investors, the wait is finally over as the DJIA set a new record close on Thursday, September 20<sup>th</sup>, 2018. Now that the recovery has come to an end, it can be put into historical context.

## The recovery took a while...

While the market didn't see a sizeable loss compared to other market downturns, 2018 was notable as it was the 23<sup>rd</sup> longest period in between all-time highs for the DJIA at 164 days. In fact, it finished just short of 22<sup>nd</sup> place, which was the 165-day recovery way back in 1905!

Since the financial crisis (see #7), there has only been one other recovery that has taken longer, in 2015-2016 (see #15).

## Visualizing the pain

Ultimately, with a maximum loss of -11.6%, this wasn't a market "crash" by any means. It didn't come close to hitting the -20% loss commonly used as a "bear market" indicator. Honestly, it barely hit the -10% threshold used for a market "correction." Really, what happened for 164 trading days in 2018 was a lot of sideways movement.

In the broader scheme of things, the post financial crisis bull market is alive and well. The chart below visualizes the market's health despite the recent setback, as the post-crisis run is one of the most consistent performers behind the bull market of the 1990s.

## Comparing the recovery to similar downturns

Now that the recent streak is broken at 164 days, the peer analysis chart from July can be updated with finalized numbers.

Given the length of time to set a new all-time high, one might have expected to see a slightly larger maximum loss. However, the relationship between loss and recovery length is fairly weak. Remember, this is not some exact science!

## So, what's next?

Of course, while history may be helpful to contextualize past events, it provides no guarantee of future events.

The recent all-time high could be the beginning of a new run up, similar to the recent 2015-2016 downturn. On the other hand, the market has not seen a "true" bear since the financial crisis. But, the financial crisis was quite severe and it would be unusual to see a loss event as severe as that so soon. <i>Buuuuuuut</i>, on the other <i>other</i> hand, market valuations are high by many historical standards.

What's the answer? No one knows! History can provide a few templates or scenarios as a basis for potential future events but the future will always have clever new ways to surprise investors.
