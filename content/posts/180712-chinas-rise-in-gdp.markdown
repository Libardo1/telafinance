China's ascension to the world stage has been impossible to ignore. Year after year, new signs of the country's economic prowess emerge. Whether it be construction, energy consumption, consumer spending, or another key economic metric, the world's most populous nation continues to test the sole supremacy of the United States. 

To measure this rise, gross domestic product ("GDP") offers a standard tool for comparison. And from that perspective, Asia's economic miracle is moving full steam ahead.

## A Challenger Appears

Since the end of World War II, there have been three major challengers to US economic dominance. The first was the Soviet Union during the cold war. The Soviets, although terrifying from a nuclear perspective, did not pose as great of an economic challenge as Japan did in the 1980's and early 1990's. The chart below provides a useful visual of that economic horse race.

While Japan's growth may not look as impressive charted from 2017's point of view, Japan at its peak had a relatively larger nominal GDP compared to the US than China does today.

Unfortunately for Japan, their rise topped out in 1995, followed by a long decline due to a stagnant economy and the US's continued expansion.

By the end of 2017, China was 63% as large as the US economy as measured by nominal GDP, only 8% below Japan's peak of 71%. However, nominal GDP is just one economic measure. In China's case, it may provide an inaccurate picture of their true economic might.

## China Number One?

Just a few years ago, China was noted to have become the number one country in terms of GDP as measured by purchasing power parity, which adjusts GDP to account for relative differences in cost of goods and services. While GDP as measured by purchasing power parity may have its drawbacks, such as more reliance on estimation, the writing on the wall is clear: China has surpassed the United States. By a lot.

The IMF and World Bank peg China's GDP by purchasing power as almost 20% larger than the US as of 2017. Even if Americans are sometimes chided as living under a rock when it comes to world affairs, China's rise continues to be increasingly difficult for the world's superpower to ignore.

## Currency Manipulation

China's dominance in GDP as measured by purchasing power is juxtaposed by the aforementioned nominal GDP estimates, which are relatively lower. Calculated based on exchange rates, nominal GDP can cause volatility in measurements year-to-year based on market forces as opposed to actual changes in standards of living. For example, China's currency weakness versus the dollar in 2015 and 2016 caused the slight dip on an otherwise smooth trend in the GDP charts above.

In China's case, the currency distortion is particularly acute, as their currency strength relative to the dollar is managed by their central bank. This management, as opposed to allowing market forces determine currency strength as is typical, has led to critical charges of China as a "currency manipulator."

For a country of China's economic size, the lack of currency determination by market forces causes distortions in the world economy. The enormous gap between nominal GDP and GDP by purchasing power is just one such peculiarity.

Whether China's currency is manipulated to be undervalued (by some estimates from 10% to 40%) is thoroughly debated. If it is, then estimates for nominal GDP and the charts presented above <i>understate</i> China's rise.

## Shrinking Superlatives

While two different GDP measures show two different winners, one trend is undeniable - the economic supremacy of the United States is waning.

While it hasn't been a smooth ride, the US has gone from generating 40% of the world's nominal GDP to only 24%. In the short term, this trend may reverse, as has been the case on two other occasions in the last six decades. However, it is unlikely the US will ever assume as great a proportion of world GDP as it once did, leaving regional superpowers with greater influence over their respective domains.

In terms of military might, market valuation, private enterprise, advanced technology, or even political power, the United States retains top billing. But for many measures, the gap between the US and its competition is shrinking. GDP just tells a summary of that detailed story.

## An Uncertain Future

If the future is unknown, it helps to be adaptable. And the US is just that. It is one of many significant advantages that has kept the country on top for so long.

For nominal GDP, the status of the dollar as the world's most important currency is another key asset. Either China's currency will have to strengthen relative to the dollar or their economic growth will have to continue to outpace the US. While the initial rise has been quick, marginal gains may be harder to come by. China's growth could slow, their currency could weaken, or the US's growth rate could increase. Japan had a swift rise and equally swift fall. At the same time, the trends that are pushing China to the top could remain or accelerate.

Predicting the future state and interactions amongst the world's superpowers is a crowded and opinionated field. No matter the outcome, the US should stay mindful of the global landscape. Time will always bear new challengers claiming rightful heir to the throne.
