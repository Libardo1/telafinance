Since the 1900's, the stock market has <i>generally</i> increased at a decent pace with a few major exceptions. This is a good thing, because when it comes to investing, everyone wants to make money. For investors, most of the time they watch their investments grow and can laugh at the hyper-conservative among us who keep their savings under the mattress.

The chart above is a standard nominal representation of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Looking at a chart like this, one may think that anyone who invested in the market prior to say, 1980, has been lucky and didn't have to deal with much pain. Even in the most severe dips of the market since 1980, investors have been multiples ahead of any period prior to 1980. One might look at that and say, well perhaps the best time to invest is past and there is no "easy" entry point that will guarantee a safe investment. While it's true there are no guaranteed returns, it's important to recognize that in 1980, or any other time, future returns weren't guaranteed either.

If one were an investor in 1980, this is the historical chart that would have been available. An investor at that time would have been saying the same thing that an investor today might say, "I wish I had put my money in the market 40 years ago!" Making matters even more difficult, investors in 1980 had dealt with almost 15 years of turbulent market activity banded mostly between 800 and 1000 points but with two significant dips into the 600s. To add to investor fear, the great depression wasn't some barely noticeable blip on a nominal graph like it is today.

So, the same lesson held for those in 1980 as it does for investors today. Anything that could remotely be considered a "guaranteed" return only came through holding an investment for a long period of time, through ups and downs. In the case of an investment in 1980, that is almost 40 years ago now, the general length of time for an individual's working life, just as it was for an investor in 1980 who had held since 1940.

As a final caveat, it's important to remember that while a forty-year investment holding horizon may seem overly conservative, there is still a famous example of even that not being long enough. Of course, that would be the great depression as seen below.

Up to mid-1929, things had been looking so good! Just a few years later, nearly every investment entry point over the prior 30 years was underwater. Peak-to-trough, the stock market crashed nearly 90% and would need 29 years to recover to new all-time highs. That being said, if one had invested any time after 1915 they would have been okay holding for forty years too! Let's just hope investors today have it a little easier than stomaching a 90% drop on their investing journey. Fingers crossed.
